As your dirigible chugs along over the desert, the wind begins to beat 
harder about you. Looking out to the desert, you see a massive wall of 
sand stretching across the horizon. The grimoire you brought with you 
has warned about massive sandstorms caused by the rampant magic in the 
area, but you never thought that you’d see one up close. There are 
flashes of lightning in the sandstorm, and the compass spins wildly as 
the storm grows closer. There is a small canyon that you could land in 
and attempt to weather the storm. Alternatively you could attempt to 
pass through the storm or try and fly around the outside of the storm.

//On this, there are your three companions, each with a word bubble over
 their heads as they give their opinion. You can click on them to hear 
 in detail what they think about this.
 
Jeric- "To retreat is dishonor."
Harold- "I can pull us along the outskirts."
Elaine- "The storm wants to kill us; the canyon does not."

Jeric clicked on- "Strength is found in conquering weakness. You see 
 that brewing wall of death? Now imagine pushing through it and living 
 to tell the tale! THAT is how we improve. Tear down the walls you fear 
 and what’s left to be afraid of? And if we go down, may it be with 
 thunder and lightning!! If that’s what it takes to end this journey, 
 then it is truly worthy of finishing us.”
 
Harold clicked on- “We’d best steer around the outskirts. Sure, maybe we
 can sit tight in a canyon, but then we’re just waiting for a disaster 
 to break us in half, not to mention the fuel it’ll cost to bring us 
 airborne again. I say we stay in motion and go the long way. It’s more 
 important to make it home then it is to race the clock.”
 
Elaine clicked on- “I’ve never seen something so monstrous and, to be 
 curt, bloody terrifying… If we want to keep our britches out of the way
 of puddles, we’d best sit tight in that canyon. Please, for my sake, 
 don’t charge into the mouth of the particularly hungry alligator that 
 at this point is no longer hidden due to the certainty it feels about 
 killing us.”

==========Expansion===========
********Canyon (-2 reserve)********
You settle down in the canyon and the storm rolls 
over you. There are crackles of magical energy in the storm and you can 
feel the entire ship shake. Luckily most of the storm passes over you, 
however piloting the ship out of the canyon takes more fuel than you 
thought.

Jeric- “*grumbling* Yet another opportunity wasted, yet another day I 
 live…”
Harold- “We coulda saved on fuel, but I suppose we’re still alive.”
Elaine- “Wonderful! If we’d decided to brave the storm I imagine my wits would’ve 
 gone parachuting.”
  
********Through Storm (+2 explosion)********
As you fly through the storm, the sand tears at your ship, blasting the 
paint of the sides. A great bolt of lightning blasts along your ship...

    ***If Player Explodes***
    overloading your engines and causing them to belch out black smoke. 
    The deck drops, and you feel yourself falling, and hear a terrible 
    splintering sound as your ship crashes into the ground.
    
    Jeric- “A mighty fine eruption! And yet, I still draw breath… 
        Clearly the storm was unworthy of finishing me off.”
    Harold- “GREAT. Very fine choice, captain. Next time, why don’t you 
        steer us into a mountain!”
    Elaine- “*shaking* You know, we’ll never make it through this if we 
        toss ourselves into pits of feral raptors at every given 
        opportunity. Please don’t ever do that again.”
        
    ***If Player does not Explode***
    luckily the ribs of your ballon cause the energy to harmlessly 
    disperse along your ship.
    
    Jeric- “We made it through the other side. Don’t you feel stronger?
        What could stop us now?”
    Harold- “We got lucky, kid. Don’t pull anything like that again. I 
        plan on seeing my grandkids, thank you.”
    Elaine- “Well, that could’ve gone worse. But if you intended to stop 
        my heart, a basketful of puppies would’ve been preferable in the
        future.”

********Through Storm (+1 roll)********
You turn your ship and head to the side of the storm. With a strong push,
 you manage to pull just out of the path of the sand storm, and while 
 you’ve avoided the major danger, you will have a longer journey to get 
 to your destination, and more chances for something to go wrong. 
 
    Jeric- “You’ll never overcome anything if you choose to run away.”
    Harold- “Good call, cap. We’re a little behind schedule, but 
        storms’ll do that.”
    Elaine- “I thought going around would be quite literally next to the
        storm. *chuckling* Glad I was mistaken!”1
